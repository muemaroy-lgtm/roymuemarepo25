# First Assignment – Criminology AI Personality Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI system that analyzes and generates personality reports based on given profiles. It’s part of my criminology AI coursework. The system uses **JAC (Jaseci Agent Code)** scripts to simulate agent behavior and process inputs, producing structured personality insights.

---

## Features
- Input a person's **name** and **bio**.
- AI agents analyze the input to detect personality traits.
- Generates a **case report** with insights.
- Supports multiple profiles in a structured `.jac` file.

---

## Files in this Assignment
- `assignment.jac` – Main script containing profiles and agent calls.
- `hello.jac` – Example script demonstrating the basic AI agent functionality.
- `README.md` – This documentation.
- `.gitignore` – Ignores virtual environments, cache, and other unnecessary files.

---

## External Libraries / APIs Used
- **Jaseci (`jac-py`)** – For agent scripting and orchestration.
- **Python 3.12** – Programming environment.
- (Optional: Include any other libraries you imported in the assignment.)
