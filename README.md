# 🚀 Roy Code Base

**Roy Code Base** is a practical project built to explore how backend AI agents and security-driven logic can connect seamlessly using Python, FastAPI, and Jaseci (JAC).  
It’s a sandbox for learning, building, and integrating — not just coding.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a flexible and smart environment where:
- **AI models** (like Gemini or OpenAI) can be integrated with code agents.  
- **Backend logic** runs through **FastAPI**, providing endpoints for testing and automation.  
- **Jac agents (Jaseci)** handle reasoning, automation, and data flow in a structured way.  

This setup forms a clean base for applied AI research, API development, or secure backend design.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.12+**
- **FastAPI** for backend API routes  
- **Uvicorn** for running the development server  
- **Jaseci (JAC)** for agent logic and task coordination  
- **Google Generative AI** for text generation (optional integration)
